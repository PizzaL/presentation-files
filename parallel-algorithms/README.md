# Parallel Algorithms

The code for the Parallel Algorithms presentation is in the
[cputube](https://github.com/dietmarkuehl/cputube/tree/master/cpu/algorithm)
repository. It depends on some code from the `algorithm` branch of
[kuhllib](https://github.com/dietmarkuehl/kuhllib/tree/algorithm)
as well as on some libaries, notably
[TBB](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/).

Speaker Bio:
    Dietmar Kühl is a senior software developer at Bloomberg L.P. working
    on the data distrubtion environment used both internally and by
    enterprise installations at clients. In the past, he has done mainly
    consulting for software projects in the finance area. He is a regular
    attendee of the ANSI/ISO C++ standards committee and a moderator
    of the newsgroup comp.lang.c++.moderated.
Location: London (UK)
Description:
   This presentation discusses why it is useful to move some of the
   processing to compile time and shows some applications of doing
   so. In particular it shows how to create associative containers
   created at compile time and what is needed from the types involved
   to make it possible. The presentation also does some analysis
   to estimate the costs in terms for compile-time and object file
   size.

   Specifically, the presentation
   - discusses the implications of static and dynamic initialization
   - the C++ language rules for implementing constexpr functions and classes supporting constexpr objects
   - differences in error handling with constant expressions
   - sorting sequences at compile time and the needed infrastructure
   - creating constant associative containers with compile-time and run-time look-up

   It is expected that attendees have a working knowledge of C++
   but no prior knowledge of using constexpr is required. The code
   samples will contain lots of templates and sometimes unusual
   uses of the language.
Expected Experience Level: Intermediate
